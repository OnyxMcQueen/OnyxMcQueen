## **Prologue**

Welcome to my profile! My main goal of utilizing this space is to connect and network with others whilst constantly updating my Github profile to reflect growth as a developer! As time progresses I am hoping to construct this Github slate into a decorative piece filled with projects and developments that resonate with me, feel free to look around!

## **About Me**

Where do I start? Well there's tons of information I'd love to share about myself! If anything sounds interesting feel free to reach out to me about them! 

* **Car Enthusiast** 🏁. Before software development I wanted to become a mechanical engineer. Crazy right?!? 😱 It's such an exhilarating and electrifying experience driving your favorite cars, having an appreciation for the performance and power of such elegantly crafted machines. Engines and exhaust notes are therapeutic to my ears! 

* **Astronomy/Space** 🌌. Have you ever looked up at the night sky and truly wondered our place in the universe? I mean... we are on a floating blue ball zipping through space at a blistering speed. It's truly humbling to look up and see the finest creations, structures and places we'll never lay our eyes on in person. Throughout my free time I always head on over to NASA's official website and just gaze upon the Hubble's images of stars, supernovas and other magnificent structures 💫. 

* **Avid Nature Lover** 🌱. I highly recommend checking out the "Earth Porn" subreddit on Reddit if you love photography shots of nature. In nature, no matter the environment, there is a common theme with all of them each giving them their distinctive features. Natural environments can stimulate the senses, providing new and fresh scents, a beautiful array of colours to see, a range of textures to touch and a host of calming sounds, a long term goal would be to settle in reclusive get-away home, kinda like Tom Cruise in the movie Oblivion. 

* **Magic Card Tricks** ✨. I would not call myself a magician by any means, this is just a recreational thing for me, but I recall watching a video on a magician using a technique called Sleight of Hand to misdirect and distract the audience while performing the trick, it was so captivating, as an observer you goal is to find holes in the trick and uncover how the magician did it, and the wow factor kicks in when you least expect it to happen. I mainly play around with a deck of cards and practice my dexterity, I hope these magic tricks come in handy as a icebreaker one day 😆.
